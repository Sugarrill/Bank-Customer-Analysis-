    "    - France has the highest value, then Germany and Spain has the same values.\n",

    "- The analysis between Credit Score and Balance reveals a similar relationship across genders. Both men and women exhibit a positive correlation between credit score and balance, with individuals holding higher balances tending to have higher credit scores. There is no significant difference in the strength or nature of the relationship between genders.\n",
